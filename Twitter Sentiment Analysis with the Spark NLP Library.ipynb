    "# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with the Spark NLP Library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was developed using the [all-spark-notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook) and should work without modification in that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier this year, I produced a [similar notebook](https://www.zepl.com/viewer/notebooks/bm90ZTovL3JvYm9yYXRpdmUvVHdpdHRlci1TZW50aW1lbnQtRXhhbXBsZS9hNTlmZjFkYTAzY2Y0ZWY0YTg5MWRlNjZkMWFlM2I0My9ub3RlLmpzb24) using [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/). In that project, I used the [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) library to analyze sentiment of a Twitter stream of tweets about Donald Trump. The CoreNLP library is not specific to Spark but is written in Java so it's trivial to use it from within Spark. However, recent investigation into the current NLP space in the Spark ecosystem unearthed the recently released [NLP library](http://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/index.html) from [John Snow Labs](http://www.johnsnowlabs.com). The library includes a sentiment analyzer which utilizes a novel approach based on the [research](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6143) and [code](https://github.com/vivekn/sentiment) produced by Vivek Narayanan et al. In the paper, the authors claim an 88% accuracy on sentiment prediction of reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).\n",
    "\n",
    "As I considered this project, I came across a [data set of tweets about Trump](https://www.kaggle.com/ahsanijaz/trumptweets) which includes 4600 tweets collected on August 17, 2015. The data set stood out because the tweets were manually labeled as positive or negative. Of course, having pre-labeled data has proven tremedously helpful in evaluating a supervised sentiment analyzer as the labor-intensive work of providing classified data has already been performed by the provider (`ahsanijaz`). \n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to the IMDB data set of 25000 reviews, the tweet data set is much more limited in number and in length of text. Nevertheless, in this notebook the analysis of the tweet data set resulted in an accuracy of 88.1%. As the Vivekn et al approach is based on a Naive Bayes model which lends itself to shorter text according to [prior research](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf), it appears to be a good choice for analyzing this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One factor that made a significant difference in the performance of the model is the approach taken here of not removing duplicate data from the training set. If duplicate data is removed from the set the accuracy drops to 83.7%. Duplicate tweets result primarily from the processing approach taken below in which retweets are represented in the data. Furthermore, the common indicators of a retweet ('RT' and 'via') have been removed from the tweets which results in a modest futher redundancy. It may be the case that the redundancy helps reinforce the general mood of the population and thereby helps shift the weighting in a beneficial way. However, it also seems likely that the approach may cause overfitting of the data as it is more probable that duplicate tweets will appear in both the training and test sets. In this notebook, I have not tested this hypothesis but it certainly would be beneficial in getting better confidence in the resulting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation details\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I could begin to analyze the data, data wrangling was necessary. The source file (`trumptweets.csv`) appears to have a Windows-1252 encoding and oddly has fewer columns defined than the data it describes. While the data is loaded using the Windows-1252 encoding, encoding artifacts remain that could influence the analysis of the tweets and may be worth further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to align the data with the defined columns, I add a nonce header value (`X_copy`). Furthermore, the Spark CSV parser behaves in a subtlely different way when periods (`.`) exist in the column names so I modified these as well. Finally, the original data used backslashes to escape quotes (`\\\"`) rather than the more common approach of using double quotes (`\"\"`) so I substituted the former with the later so that the Spark CSV parser would work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I examined the data, I came across many instances of peculiar text like `<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0089>`. After much fr research, I was able to determine that the text actually was an R artifact (specifically, it seems that the data was pulled from Twitter using the R ‘twitteR’ package) and are the result of R translating emojis to text (see [Emoticons decoder for social media sentiment analysis in R](http://opiateforthemass.es/articles/emoticons-in-R/) and [Twitter emoji encoding problems with twitteR and R](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37999896/twitter-emoji-encoding-problems-with-twitter-and-r) for details). I found a [resource](https://github.com/today-is-a-good-day/emojis/blob/master/emojis.csv) that provided an exhaustive list of emojis in this format and which I was able to use to map to text equivalents (eg, 😊 to \"smiling face with smiling eyes\")."
