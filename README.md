# Getting started

This notebook was developed using [all-spark-notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook). I recommend it as a way to get started if you don't currently have an environment set up with Jupyter and Spark. 

Please see the [Notebook](Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20the%20Spark%20NLP%20Library.ipyn) for further details.
